About WePay: WePay is a secure payment processor that makes it easy to start accepting payments online in under two minutes. There are no contracts, set up fees, or monthly fees. See pricing.

Plugin: Allows you to easily take payments from customers using WePay's Checkout system. If you do not have an account or API credentials, this plugin will get all that for you! No need for an SSL but it is recommended.

How to install:

1. Drag and drop the includes folder directly into your catalog directory. It will only over write old WePay Files if upgrading.
2. Activate the plugin from the admin
3. Put in your API credentials for this plugin. If you do not have API credentials yet, there is a link on the activation page of the plugin in the admin, click on it, you will be able to obtain the credentials needed, do not perform an automatic update.
4. Run a payment thru.


To get API Credentials:

1. Login to Admin
2. Goto Modules > Payment
3. Select WePay
4. Click on the link that says "Get API Credentials"
5. Fill out the form and hit view credentials.
6. Copy and paste the credentials to the appropriate location in the Wepay module setup.
